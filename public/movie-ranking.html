<h1>Top Movies according to Me</h1>
<h2>My top movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Gladiator</h3>
<p>
  What makes Gladiator such a beautiful film is its powerful storytelling,
  breathtaking cinematography, and unforgettable performances—especially Russell
  Crowe’s raw, emotional portrayal of Maximus. The film is filled with themes of
  resilience, justice, and destiny, all woven together with an epic score by
  Hans Zimmer that adds depth to every scene. The battle sequences are visually
  spectacular, yet the quiet, introspective moments make the film deeply moving.
  At its heart, Gladiator is a story of a man who fights not just for revenge,
  but for the restoration of Rome’s true spirit.

<h3>End Game</h3>
<p>
  What makes Endgame beautiful is its emotional weight—every character arc comes
  full circle, delivering moments of triumph and heartbreak. From Iron Man's
  unforgettable sacrifice to Captain America's journey home, the film resonates
  because it honors the legacy of its heroes. The visual spectacle is
  breathtaking, but it's the human stories woven into the cosmic battle that
  leave a lasting impact.

<h3>Lucy</h3>
<p>
  What makes Lucy a beautiful film is its blend of action, philosophy, and
  stunning visuals. Scarlett Johansson delivers a mesmerizing performance,
  portraying Lucy’s evolution from an ordinary woman to a being beyond human
  comprehension. The film explores deep existential themes about intelligence,
  consciousness, and the nature of existence, making it more than just an
  action-packed thriller. The cinematography, combined with its fast-paced
  storytelling and symbolic imagery, creates a visually captivating experience.
